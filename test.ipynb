But its slow descent toward the central bank\\'s 2% target has been slow and uneven.\\n\\nThe SEP forecasts inflation to drop to 3.3% by year-end, and to approach the central bank\\'s average annual 2% target.\\n\\nAt the subsequent press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tempered rosier economic projections with a warning that inflation has a long way to go before reaching that target.\\n\\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 11, 2023.
